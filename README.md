## Basketball Scoring app

### The Brief

Build an app that lets a sports fan keep track of their favourite sports league.

As a huge fan of basketball, you want to stay up to date with the league. You're interested to see which team leads the table and who won the latest matchesâ€¦

### MVP:
* The app should allow the user to create, edit and remove teams in the league
* The user should be able to create new games
* There should be a way to display all the games for a team and all the teams involved in a match
* The app should display if a match was won or lost

### Possible Extensions:
* Create a league table to see who is on top of the league
* Add players to teams and let them have match stats (points won, fouls, etc.)
* Anything else you can think of

### The Outcome

### Key Features

- Users can easily view information about the teams in the league, individually or all at once.
- Teams can be edited or deleted directly from the app.
- Teams wins can be updated.
- Matches can be viewed and created. Viewing a match will show you the winner.
